# OOP-Challenges

**We prepared multiple OOP Challenges.** 

**Each challenge is in different BRANCH. Please switch branch to see challenge description with completed code.**

We were looking for some OOP challenges, little projects you could do to practice OOP concepts. However we didn't find anything sufficient, so we created our own challenges. We implemented challenges in Java as best as we could. Maybe you can learn something from them. 

If you want to take some OOP challenge, we encourage you to first read instructions in README and trie to implement your solution as best as you can. Afterwards you can check our solution (which is committed in given branch) to compare your solution with ours and learn from it. 

### Challenges:
